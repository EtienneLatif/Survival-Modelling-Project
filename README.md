# Survival-Modelling-Project
Coursework applying survival modelling concepts to real world data.

# Task 1

The first task concerns data on the survival time of patients with lymphocytic non-Hodgkins lymphoma, some values of which were censored. Both the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aaler estimators were deployed to estimate and plot the survival function for two sub-groups of the patients and the results using both estimators compared. These estimates were also used to perform inference on survival probabilities for different lengths of time.

# Task 2

The second task is an investigation of survival regression models. This involved discussing the suitability of a Weibull distribution as a model for the life-span of radio-tagged ducks and exploring the usefulness of weight, age and length of the duck as explanatory variables for predicting life-span. These dependencies were also examined using a Cox proportional hazards model as an alternative.

# Task 3

The final task is based on data from a pension scheme. Two separate life tables were constructed under the assumptions of constant force of mortality and a uniform distribution of deaths within each year and used to calculate the complete and curtate life expectancies for males and females at a given age. The mortality rates in the data were compared against the standard mortality rates from the English Life Tables No. 17 (ELT17) to determine whether the standard mortality rates were an appropriate model for this data.
